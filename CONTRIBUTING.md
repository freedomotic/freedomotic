# Contributing to Freedomotic

Hello and thanks for your interest in our project!

## Git repository is an SDK

The GIT repository is a complete SDK with all you need to code and test your Freedomotic plugins. Once compiled for the first time open the freedomotic-core project with your favourite IDE and start it to try Freedomotic.

To develop your own plugin you can start from the "hello-world" example project included in GIT_ROOT/plugins/devices/hello-world. Open it in your IDE, make some changes and compile. It will be automatically installed into the freedomotic runtime (freedomotic-core project). Just start freedomotic-core to try your latest changes.


## Reporting issues

Freedomotic uses GitHub’s integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

- Before you submit an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/issues) to see if someone has already reported the problem.
- If the issue doesn’t already exist, create a new issue.
- Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Freedomotic that you are using, as well as your Operating System and JVM version. 
- If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. 

Some of them are easier than others. The [easy](https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/labels/easy)
label can be used to find the easy issues. If you want to work on an issue, please leave a comment so that we can assign it to you!
