- Before you submit an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/issues) to see if someone has already reported the problem.
- If the issue doesn’t already exist, create a new issue.
- Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Freedomotic that you are using, as well as your Operating System and JVM version. 
- If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. 

Some of them are easier than others. The [easy](https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/labels/easy)
