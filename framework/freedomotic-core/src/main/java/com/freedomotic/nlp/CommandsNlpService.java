/**
 * Listen for free-form (natural language) text commands on channel
 * <strong>"app.commands.interpreter.nlp"</strong> and using NLP tools execute
 * the most similar command that the framework has in memory. For example a
 * speech recognition utility may return a free-form text that can be
 * interpreted by this module as an executable command. Another example is a
 * chat bot that executes text commands.
 *
 * It expects a command with the following properties
 * <ul>
 * <li>text = A_STRING</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * It replies back if the received command cannot be interpreted, so you can
 * send the command and expect a reply in a given timeout. Read the see section
 * for more info.
